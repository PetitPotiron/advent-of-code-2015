# advent-of-code-2015
This repository contains my code for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) ([what is it?](#what-is-it))2015. You can find the challenges [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015). I mainly used Python but I also took this opportunity to improve my skills in Rust, JavaScript and a bit of other languages. Enjoy!

## How to use this repository?
In the `src` folder, you can find one folder for each day of the challenge (from `day-1` to `day-25`). In these folders, there are two folders: `first-part` and `second-part` who contain . In these directories, there are four files : 
- `README.md` where I explain how I solved (or not) the challenge.
- `challenge.md` is the instructions of the part of the challenge.
- `main.py`, `index.js`, or `main.rs`. It's the code which completes the challenge, respectively in [Python](https://www.python.org), [JavaScript](https://w.wiki/7z9P) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).
- `input.txt` is the input with what we are going to work with the code.
- `output.txt` is the result gotten, once the code has been run.

## What is it?
The Advent Of Code is an online advent calendar which contains programming challenges. Each day, you can solve a problem and maybe enter the leaderboard (yes, there is one!). It is completely free, and you can share solutions since the leaderboard is full. I didn't participate to the 2015 edition, but I created these codes when training on this previous edition.
