# advent-of-code-2015
This is my code for the [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com) 2015. You can find the challenges [here](https://adventofcode.com/2015). I mainly used Python but I also took this opportunity to improve my skills in Rust, JavaScript and a bit of other languages. Enjoy!

## How to use this repository?
In the `src` folder, there are folders for all days from `day-1` to `day-25`. In these folders, there are two folders: `first-part` and `second-part`. In these directories, there are four files : 
- `README.md` where I explain how I solved (or not) the challenge.
- `challenge.md` is the instructions of the part of the challenge.
- `main.py`, `index.js`, or `main.rs`. It's the code which completes the challenge, respectively in [Python](https://www.python.org), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) or [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) (then there will be the executable file too : `main.exe`).
- `input.txt` is the input with what we are going to work with the code.
- `output.txt` is the result gotten, once the code has been run.
